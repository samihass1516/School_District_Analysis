## School_District_Analysis

# Purpose:
This analysis aims to help Maria, the data scientist for a city school district. Maria is responsible for analyzing information from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats.  In this role, she prepares all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.  In this challenge, I will help Maria with analyzing data on student funding and standardized test scores.  I will access every student's math and reading test scores from different districts, including public and charter schools.
I will use Pandas and Jupyter files to analyze the student data to help Maria.  I will;
1.	Prepare the Data
2.	Summarize the Data
3.	Drill Down Into the Data
4.	Compare Subsets of Data
5.	Aggregate the Data

#### When I finished with my report and data analysis, I found that there wasnâ€™t much difference between the test results in the Math and Reading category.  The Charter and Public Schools were very close in their results, thus showing the same level of performance.
